Hey there!
I'm Jason, a Software Engineer III at Squarespace on the Domains team. I got my BS in Computer Science from New York University, and am Canadian-born, Hong Kong-raised, and American-educated.

Previously to Squarespace, I was an engineer on the FPG team at MediaMath, leading a team of three other engineers in building out a mission-critical ETL process as a service from scratch that affected >90% of company revenue. We built out everything from an initial proof of concept to adding in the final layers of resiliency and monitoring. Because of our work, the service directly decreased our client friction by >90%, and enabled multiple new revenue streams for the company.

I'm an all-purpose software engineer that can do everything from full-stack web-dev, to building out general command-line programs, to singing in the shower badly.

I have a lot of experience with different programming languages, and can pick up languages pretty quickly as well. Off the bat I can program anything in Java, Python, Bash, C, JavaScript, and LaTeX. Based off of the problem given, I'll determine and use the best tool for the job, and am trained in a language-agnostic fashion to solve the problem with the best tool available.

For web dev, I have prior experience building out APIs/services from scratch in Node + Express in JavaScript, or via the Django framework in Python.

For dev-ops, I have setup automated and error-tolerant development pipelines, automated roll-out/deployments, and leveraged framework testing suites in order to increase developer velocity and code-base stability.

Outside of general software development, I have a passion for Fencing and creating small projects. I am an ardent supporter of the EFF and ACLU for their amazing work for netizens in the 21st century, along with UNICEF for helping children's development in developing countries.
