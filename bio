Hey there!
I'm Jason, a Software Engineer (Financial Platform) at MediaMath.
I got my BS in Computer Science from New York University, and
am Canadian-born, Hong Kong-raised, and American educated.

I'm an all-purpose developer that can do everything from
full-stack web-dev, to building out general command-line
programs, to scaling out API endpoints, to singing in the
shower badly.

I have a lot of experience with different languages,
and can pick up languages pretty quickly as well.
Off the bat I can program anything in Java, Python,
Bash, C, JavaScript, and LaTeX. Based off of the problem
given, I'll determine and use the best tool for the job,
and am trained in a language-agnostic fashion.

For web dev, I have prior experience building out APIs/
services from scratch in Node + Express in JavaScript, or
via the Django framework in Python.

For dev-ops, I can setup automated and error-tolerant
development pipelines, automated roll-out/deployments,
and leverage framework testing suites in order to increase
developer velocity and code-base stability.

For a recent project that I've done, in Fall 2016 I was
the team lead of a group of 5 to build out a Java to C++
transpiler. We fully leveraged git flow, modern OOP design
paradigms, and dealt with an under-documented and finicky
3rd party library that was a core requirement of the project.

I'm proud to say that we delivered the project to spec,
and had one of the cleanest, easiest-to-modify, and robust
codebases out of any team.

Outside of general software development, I have a passion
for Fencing and creating small projects. I am an ardent
supporter of the EFF and ACLU for their amazing work for
netizens in the 21st century, along with UNICEF for helping
children's development in developing countries.
