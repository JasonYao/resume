Hey there!
I'm Jason, a Software Engineer on Google's Search Feature Debugger team, helping to design and build world-class debugging and introspection tools for 10s of thousands of Google Search engineers.

I got my BA in Computer Science from New York University, and am Canadian-born, Hong Kong-raised, and American-educated.

Previously to Google, I was an engineer at Squarespace on their Domains team, helping to propose, design, and implement everything required for turning Squarespace into a full-fledged Domain Registrar, building in new features/resiliency layers/observability into the existing Domains and Squarespace Emails product, and creating the first automated Fraud Detection system for Domains at Squarespace.

I'm an all-purpose software engineer with lots of experience in web product engineering, dev-ops automation, and singing in the shower badly.

Outside of general software development, I have a passion for home bartending and creating small projects. I am an ardent supporter of the EFF and ACLU for their amazing work for netizens and privacy/freedom.
