# Resume
By [Jason Yao](https://github.com/jasonyao/)

## Description
This repo contains my resume, along with any
necessary files to generate it.

Currently, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org)
is used due to its readability, ease-of-change,
and aesthetic final output.

## Resume Generation
To generate the final `.pdf` format of the resume,
use a LaTeX compiler. The recommendation is to use
[Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), due to its ability to show the current
build (Yes, we know the latest version was back in 2015,
but newer ones pale in comparison even after all these years).
