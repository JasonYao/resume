# Static Assets

## Notes
* Mediamath is defunct so just using their old logo
* Squarespace's logo guidelines are over [here](https://www.squarespace.com/logo-guidelines),
  and we can download an asset bundle for their logo there
* Google's logo was just grabbed from wikipedia
* Two types of logos are provided:
  * A long-form logo (meant for banners)
  * A short logo (meant for favicons)
* Because of sizing & normalization constraints, we'll be using the short logo forms in the resume
